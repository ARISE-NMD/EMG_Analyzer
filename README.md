# EMG_Analyzer
Matlab Toolbox for unsupervised classification of MUAPs and action potentials in EMG

 A complete Graphical interface, plug and play tool for single channel EMG processing and unsupervised MUAP identification and Action Potential classification. Just run LEMG_Analyzer.m and the GUI will be assisting you for the further processing steps. The toolbox is able to read files with '.mat','.wav' and '.txt'. The exported files from several EMG machines such as Nihon Kohden and Synergy are supported as well.
The scripts in this toolbox are based on the following paper:
%% Algorithm is based on the following paper :
H. Sedghamiz and D. Santonocito,''Unsupervised Detection and Classification of Motor Unit Action Potentials in Intramuscular Electromyography Signals'', The 5th IEEE International Conference on E-Health and Bioengineering - EHB 2015, At Iasi-Romania.
